# INTRODUCTION

Term-Plus is a basic project to build terminal emulator using WebTechnologies. As we all know that
today, web pages are very interactive, therefore why not extend it to terminal emulators..?

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To run this emulator you need these pre-installed:
* Node.JS v8
* Coffeescript
* Electron
* NPM

# How to run..??

For running the terminal emulator you need to compile coffeescript files to js
and move the following files as shown:
* main.js -> src/electron
* terminal.js -> src/js

> **NOTE** : I have tested it only on arch linux.
